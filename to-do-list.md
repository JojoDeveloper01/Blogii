Project theme: Blogii
This project is a blog website where users can create, edit, and delete their blog posts.

A non-logged in user can only read the blog posts and create a only one blog on the local but to publish it he must be logged in, so the non-user can't publish his blog on the server, only maintain in local.
A user can produce a blog and publish it on the server as many times as he wants.

The user can administrate his blog posts on the dashboard and see analytics about his blog posts.
